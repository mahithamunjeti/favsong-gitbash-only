[Intro]
Ha, c'mon, it's gonna be fucking hard

[Verse 1]
Special edition and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues in the fittin' room and it's hot tea
No, I'm not thinking about no exes, know they miss me
I got the whole room spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us, take it to the chorus

[Chorus]
Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?
Like, like, like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
I think I really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
Haters, they don't really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
'Cause they could never ever be (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
But have you ever met JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE

[Post-Chorus]
But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?
