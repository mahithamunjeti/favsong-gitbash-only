[Intro]
Ha, c'mon, it's gonna be fucking hard

[Verse 1]
Special edition and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues in the fittin' room and it's hot tea
No, I'm not thinking about no exes, know they miss me
I got the whole room spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us, take it to the chorus

[Chorus]
Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?
Like, like, like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
I think I really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
Haters, they don't really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
'Cause they could never ever be (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
But have you ever met JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE

[Post-Chorus]
But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?
[Verse 2]
Eolmal jwodo moshae seokeoseujis
Pojinghanbeone mandeureo mosh pit
They can't deal with me 'cause I'm priceless
Yeoreo selleopdeul soge nae DNA
Get, get outta my way
Babiga cheokiga doegi jeone
Name, shame, blame tryna burst my bubble
Teoteuryeobwa geureom deo keun horeseo
Mannaneun geoya jenireul

I've slayed it, and I graved it
Yes, I'm guilty jalnan ge joeni

[Chorus]
Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?
Like, like, like
I think I really like JENNIE
Haters, they don't really like JENNIE
'Cause they could never ever be JENNIE
But have you ever met JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
Like JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
Rock with JENNIE
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed, like
[Post-Chorus]
But have you ever met JENNIE?
But have you ever met?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
